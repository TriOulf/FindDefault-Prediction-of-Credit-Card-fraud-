# FindDefault-Prediction-of-Credit-Card-fraud-

**Project Overview:**

This project tackles the challenge of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It leverages the creditcard.csv dataset, explores various algorithms, and employs AutoML for hyperparameter tuning. The final model is deployed as a pickle file for seamless integration into applications.

**Data**

Description: Contains anonymized creditcard transaction data with labeling for fraudulent or legitimate transactions. 

**Technologies:**

Python (version 3.x recommended)
pandas (data manipulation)
numpy (numerical computations)
scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)
matplotlib/seaborn (data visualization)
Optuna/TuneGrid/Hyperopt/TPOT (AutoML libraries) (Choose one)
xgboost (XGBoost algorithm) (Optional)
lightgbm (LightGBM algorithm) (Optional)
catboost (CatBoost algorithm) (Optional)
pickle (model serialization)

**requirements.txt file for the libraries used in code:**

scikit-learn==1.2.2
xgboost==1.7.6
lightgbm==4.0.0
catboost==1.2
matplotlib==3.8.0
seaborn==0.12.2
numpy==1.24.4
pandas==2.1.3


**Workflow:**
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   Load the creditcard.csv dataset using pandas.
   Explore and analyze the data (shape, data types, missing values, descriptive statistics).
   Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
   Apply feature engineering techniques (scaling, encoding, creating new features).
   Split the data into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.
   
2. Model Selection and Evaluation:
   Selecting algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest,  Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes)
   Tuning hyperparameters for each algorithm.
   Train models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the validation set using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC.
   Choose the model with the best performance on the validation set.
   
3. Model Training and Deployment:
   Retrain the chosen model on the combined training and validation sets for a more robust model.
   Evaluate the model's final performance on the held-out test set to assess generalizability.
   Serialize the final model using pickle for deployment in production environments.

**Instructions**

Clone this repository or download the project files.
Install required libraries using pip install <library_name>.
Modify the code to match the specific structure and format of your creditcard.csv dataset. Adjust data loading, feature engineering, and model evaluation accordingly.
Run the scripts to perform data preprocessing, model selection and training, evaluation, and deployment.
Utilize the generated pickle file for fraud detection in your application.

**Caveats and Considerations**

Model effectiveness depends on your dataset's balance of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Periodic model updates are recommended as fraud patterns evolve.
Address privacy and security concerns when handling sensitive financial data.

**Further Enhancements**

Explore anomaly detection techniques for potentially improved fraud identification.
Implement real-time fraud detection using online learning or streaming frameworks.
Integrate the model with a user authentication system for stronger security.
